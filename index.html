                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <h3> YUNE brand interior describes what we stand for as a team and which values ​​are of enormous
                    importance within our team.</h3>



                <h2>Why</h2>
                <h3>We believe that behaviour changes the boundaries of creative production.</h3>
                <p>Behavior is more changeable than ever due to modern media. We click, swipe and scroll around a bit.
                    Our subconscious brain curates dozens of articles, photos, videos and social media posts every day.
                    We have taught ourselves to filter very quickly and see which content we do and do not want to
                    consume.
                    In order to know which brand content appeals to the target group, we at YUNE find it crucial to
                    recognize, analyse, analyze and apply current behavior within our work. </p>



                <h2>How</h2>
                <h3>By using scientific studies, data and proofpoints, our content taps into subconscious human
                    behaviour.</h3>
                <p>As an agency, we dig through where others stop.
                    We have various in-house and partner solutions available for each phase of a project or campaign
                    with which we help the customer and ultimately the target group.
                    From tailor-made 24-hour market research to an EEG scan to measure the impact of our videos, at YUNE
                    we do everything we can to understand the subconscious brain and make brands more human.</p>



                <h2>What</h2>
                <h3>We produce impactful digital content:
                    Content - Video - Social
                </h3>
                <p>This is where we excel and can provide the most added value for our customers.
                    It helps us to keep focus in our daily work.
                </p>



                <h2>Pay-off</h2>
                <h3>Where science and creativity meet
                </h3>
                <p>Our pay-off embraces the intersection of (behavioural) science and (production) creativity. This is
                    the place where YUNE moves, hinges, sands, plays and experiments.
                </p>



                <h2>Brand values</h2>
                <h3>Honestly</h3>
                <p>If we can do better, we'll say so.</p>

                <h3>Human</h3>
                <p>We believe in the power of real content, with real people.</p>

                <h3>Slim</h3>
                <p>Of course you should never call yourself smart, but we do have the ambition to be smarter every day
                    than the day before.</p>

                <h3>Curious</h3>
                <p>What drives consumers? Why does something work today and not yesterday? At YUNE we ask the why
                    question every day.</p>

                <h3>Flexible</h3>
                <p>We move along, don't say yes but, but yes and.There is an answer to every question and a reason for
                    every behavior.</p>

                <h2>The YUNE manifest</h2>
                <h3>Can I have one co-creation?</h3>
                <p>At YUNE we believe in the power of co-creation. Between colleagues and with customers. We are
                    creative, but we do not determine what creativity is. Our best work is the work conceived together
                    with customers.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Holy Grail</h3>
                <p>A good idea starts with a strong insight into the target group and its (desired) behaviour. Our
                    behavioral scientists have extra batteries: they dig through where others stop
                </p>

                <h3>Real people, real stories</h3>
                <p>A good idea starts with a strong insight into the target group and its (desired) behaviour. Our
                    behavioral scientists have extra batteries: they dig through where others stop.</p>

                <h3>To infinity and beyond!</h3>
                <p>We think independently of channels and resources, but in terms of impact. We do this both within and
                    beyond the national borders. We love creating content for the Chinese market just as much as we do
                    for the US market.
                </p>
